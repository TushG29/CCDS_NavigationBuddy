# Welcome to our SC2006 Course Project
## About

This is a project for SC2006 (Software Engineering) where we we:
1. Developed a mobile application for CCDS students to receive notifications and view their registered courses, with secured app login system which had reset password function using e-mail and OTP
2. Created a navigation map of the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) building with panorama view, course forums, course reviews as well as frequently asked questions section within the application

Note: The School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) has been changed to College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2024. Hence, wherever SCSE is mentioned, kindly note that it is CCDS. 

## The github repository contains
  1. The relevant code for the project
  2. A folder containing pdfs of the 5 labs conducted during the course and project description. 
  3. A pdf containing the data dictionary of terms related to NTU CCDS
  4. A pdf containing the elicit and document requirements
